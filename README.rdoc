= Esearch

== DESCRIPTION
Esearchy is a small library capable of searching the internet for email addresses. Currently, we the supported search methods are engines such as Google, Bing, Yahoo, PGP servers, GoogleGroups, etc , but I intend to add many more.

Also, the library searches inside .pdf, .docx, .xlsx, .pptx, asn and .txt files for emails addresses and adds them to the list of found accounts. Finally, we have support for .docs files but for now only in Windows Platforms.

NOTE: In order to work Bing and Yahoo need an appid, for which you will have to create one for each and place them in fles so the library will be able to work properly.
* data/yahoo.key
* data/bing.key

Soon, users should be able to also pass them as parameters.

== SUPPORT:

* http://github.com/FreedomCoder/esearchy/issues
* Emails from github.

== SYNOPSIS:

For now, there are two main ways of performing a search:

* Executable CLI command

  esearchy --domain domain.com --maxhits 500 --yahoo_key dkajsdkajskdad  --output "~/emails.txt"

* Library

For thouse who want to integrate this to their application you can use it in "the ruby way"

 Esearchy.create "domain.com" do |domain|
   domain.maxhits = 500
   domain.search 
   domain.clean {|e| e =~ /<|>/ }
   domain.save_to_file "~/emails.txt"
 end

or in the more classic way in which you can create an Esearchy objetc and work on it

  domain = Esearchy.new :query => "domain.com", :maxhits => 500
  domain.search 
  domain.save_to_file "~/emails.txt"
